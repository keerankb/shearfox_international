                            <h2>Injection Molding</h2>
                            <p><h3>What is Injection Molding?</h3>
                                Injection molding is one of the most often-used manufacturing processes for creating plastic parts. Thanks to its high-precision, repeatability, and cost efficiency at scale, injection molding is used to make a variety of products and parts from the smallest medical insert up to large automotive & aerospace and defense parts. The injection molding process requires an injection molding machine, raw plastic material, and a machined mold. The raw plastic material is first melted in the injection unit and is then injected into the mold — most often machined from steel or aluminum — where it cools and solidifies into the final plastic part. The key steps in the injection molding process are clamping, injection, cooling, and ejection.<br><br>
                            <h3>Benefits Of Injection Molding</h3>
                            Custom injection molding offers a number of benefits not found in other manufacturing processes. Due to the high-pressure nature of the injection molding process, it is much easier to manufacture parts with detailed features or complex geometries that would be too costly for typical CNC machining processes. The ability to use your mold over and over again for a long period of time leads to an extremely high production output rate which is more cost effective and efficient than other manufacturing processes. Lastly, different injection molding processes, such as overmolding and insert molding, allow you to create plastic parts with unique characteristics such as enhanced strength, soft-grip surfaces, or added flexibility. Also beneficial is the ability to combine multiple assembly processes into one injection molding process.<br><br>

                            <h3>How Sheet Metal Fabrication Works</h3>
                            There are 3 common stages in the sheet metal fabrication process, all of which can be completed with various types of fabrication tools.
                            <br><br>
                            <li><strong>Material Removal:</strong> During this stage, the raw workpiece is cut to the desired shape. There are many types of tools and machining processes that can remove metal from the workpiece.</li>
                            <br><br>
                            <li><strong>Material Deformation (forming):</strong> The raw metal piece is bent or formed into a 3D shape without removing any material. There are many types of processes that can shape the workpiece.</li>
                            <br><br>
                            <li><strong>Assembling:</strong> The completed product may be assembled from several processed workpieces. 
                            Many facilities offer finishing services as well. Finishing processes are usually necessary before a sheet metal-derived product is ready for the market.</li><br><br> -->
