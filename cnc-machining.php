                            <p><h3>The Basics Of Sheet Metal Fabrication</h3>
                                CNC (Computer Numerical Controlled) machining is a means to remove material with high precision machines, using a wide variety of cutting tools to create the final design. Common CNC machines include vertical milling machines, horizontal milling machines, lathes, and routers.<br><br>    
                                <h3>How CNC Machining Works</h3>
                            To successfully make a part on a CNC machine, skilled machinists create programmed instructions using CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) software in conjunction with the CAD (Computer Aided Design) model provided by the customer. The CAD model is loaded into the CAM software and tool paths are created based on the required geometry of the manufactured part. Once the tool paths are determined, the CAM software creates G-Code (machine code) that tells the machine how fast to move, how fast to turn the stock and/or tool, and where to move the tool or workpiece in a 5-axis X, Y, Z, A, and B coordinate system.<br> <br>
                                <h3>Why Use CNC Machining For Your Parts?</h3>
                                The benefits of CNC machining are numerous. Once a tool path is created and a machine is programmed, it can run a part 1 time, or 100,000 times. CNC machines are built for precise manufacturing and repeatability which makes them cost-efficient and highly scalable. CNC machines can also work with a variety of materials from basic aluminum and plastics to more exotic materials like titanium — making them the ideal machine for almost any job. That's why CNC machining is one of the most popular methods of making plastic and metal components.
